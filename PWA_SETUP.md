# PWA (Progressive Web App) Setup

## What Was Added

Your portfolio is now a **Progressive Web App** that works offline and can be installed on devices!

### Features

1. **Offline Support**: Portfolio works without internet after first visit
2. **Installable**: Users can install it like a native app
3. **Fast Loading**: Assets are cached for instant loading
4. **Auto Updates**: Service worker updates automatically

## Files Added/Modified

### New Files
- `public/manifest.json` - PWA manifest with app metadata
- `src/components/PWAInstallPrompt.tsx` - Install prompt component
- `vite.config.ts` - Updated with PWA plugin configuration

### Modified Files
- `index.html` - Added manifest link and PWA meta tags
- `src/App.tsx` - Added PWA install prompt component
- `package.json` - Added PWA dependencies

## How It Works

### Service Worker
- Automatically generated by Vite PWA plugin
- Caches all static assets (JS, CSS, images)
- Caches external resources (Google Fonts, CDN icons)
- Updates automatically when you deploy new versions

### Caching Strategy
1. **Static Assets**: Cache-first (instant loading)
2. **Google Fonts**: Cache-first (1 year)
3. **CDN Icons**: Cache-first (30 days)
4. **Images**: Cached on first load

### Install Prompt
- Shows after 3 seconds on first visit
- Can be dismissed (won't show again for 7 days)
- Only appears on supported browsers (Chrome, Edge, Safari)

## Testing PWA

### Local Testing
1. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run preview
   ```

2. Open Chrome DevTools → Application tab
3. Check:
   - Manifest (should show app details)
   - Service Workers (should be registered)
   - Cache Storage (should have cached files)

### Test Offline Mode
1. Visit your portfolio
2. Open DevTools → Network tab
3. Check "Offline" checkbox
4. Refresh page - it should still work!

### Test Installation
1. Visit on Chrome/Edge
2. Look for install icon in address bar
3. Click to install
4. App opens in standalone window

## Browser Support

### Desktop
- ✅ Chrome/Edge (full support)
- ✅ Firefox (offline only, no install)
- ⚠️ Safari (limited support)

### Mobile
- ✅ Chrome Android (full support)
- ✅ Safari iOS (add to home screen)
- ✅ Samsung Internet (full support)

## Deployment

### Vercel (Automatic)
- PWA works automatically on Vercel
- Service worker is served correctly
- HTTPS is required (Vercel provides this)

### Important Notes
1. **HTTPS Required**: PWA only works on HTTPS (localhost is OK for testing)
2. **First Visit**: Requires internet for first visit
3. **Updates**: Service worker updates on next visit after deployment

## User Experience

### First Visit
1. User visits portfolio (requires internet)
2. Service worker installs in background
3. Assets are cached
4. Install prompt appears after 3 seconds

### Return Visits
1. Portfolio loads instantly from cache
2. Works offline
3. Service worker checks for updates
4. Updates automatically if available

### Installed App
1. Opens in standalone window (no browser UI)
2. Appears in app drawer/start menu
3. Can be launched like native app
4. Still works offline

## Customization

### Change App Name
Edit `vite.config.ts`:
```typescript
manifest: {
  name: 'Your Name Portfolio',
  short_name: 'Your Name',
  // ...
}
```

### Change Theme Color
Edit `vite.config.ts`:
```typescript
manifest: {
  theme_color: '#your-color',
  background_color: '#your-color',
  // ...
}
```

### Change App Icon
1. Replace `/public/assets/Logo.png` with your icon
2. Icon should be at least 512x512px
3. PNG format with transparent background

### Disable Install Prompt
Remove from `src/App.tsx`:
```typescript
<PWAInstallPrompt />
```

## Monitoring

### Check Service Worker Status
```javascript
// In browser console
navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistrations()
```

### Clear Cache (for testing)
1. DevTools → Application → Storage
2. Click "Clear site data"
3. Refresh page

### Force Update
```javascript
// In browser console
navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistrations().then(registrations => {
  registrations.forEach(registration => registration.update())
})
```

## Troubleshooting

### Service Worker Not Registering
- Check HTTPS (required except localhost)
- Check browser console for errors
- Clear cache and try again

### Install Prompt Not Showing
- Only shows on supported browsers
- User may have dismissed it
- Check if already installed
- Wait 3 seconds after page load

### Offline Not Working
- Visit site online first (to cache assets)
- Check service worker is registered
- Check cache storage has files
- Try hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Updates Not Applying
- Service worker updates on next visit
- May need to close all tabs
- Try clearing cache
- Check deployment was successful

2. **Performance**: Instant loading impresses visitors
3. **Accessibility**: Works in poor network conditions
4. **Mobile-Friendly**: Can be installed on phones
5. **Offline Demo**: Recruiters can view without internet

## Next Steps
